# Data Masking Tool

## Overview

This program is designed to anonymize sensitive data from CSV files by masking personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, Social Security Numbers (SSN), driverâ€™s license numbers, and other confidential details. The program ensures that data can still be used for testing, analysis, or sharing without exposing private information.

## Features

- Supports multiple locales: en_IN, en_US, es_ES, en_PH
- Configurable data masking via `config.ini`
- Option to preserve certain data fields such as age, VIN make/model, and null values
- Ensures unique identifiers remain consistent across different datasets
- Can delete original files after processing (configurable option)
- Provides flexible column mapping for CSV files
- Supports data obfuscation while maintaining data integrity for testing and development
- Generates the masked file as `fake_originalfilename.csv`

## Configuration

The program reads settings from a `config.ini` file, which allows customization of data masking behavior. Below are some key configuration options:

### General Settings

- **Locale**: Defines the regional settings for anonymized data.
- **Header**: Indicates whether the CSV has a header.
- **WriteHeaderInOutput**: Specifies whether the output CSV should include a header.
- **PreserveIds**: If enabled, keeps original IDs unchanged.
- **PreserveAge**: Ensures that the age field remains unchanged while anonymizing other data.
- **PreserveEmailDomain**: Retains the domain part of email addresses (e.g., @example.com).
- **PreserveVINMakeModel**: Ensures vehicle information remains accurate while anonymizing other details.
- **PreserveNulls**: Keeps null values unchanged in the output dataset.
- **UniquenessPreservation**: Ensures consistency for key identifiers such as Id, SSN, Email, Phone, etc.
- **DeleteOriginalFile**: Option to remove the original input file after processing.

### Mappings

This section defines how columns in the CSV map to known data fields. Example:

```
Id = id
First = first
Last = last
Street = street
City = city
State = state
Zip = zip
DOB = date
SSN = ssn
Gender = gender
Email = email
Phone = phone
Drivers license = drivers_license
Policy Number = Policy_Number
Claim number = Claim_Number
VIN = VIN
TIN = TIN
User ID = userid
License Plate = license_plate
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lowa2022/DataMaskingTool.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd DataMaskingTool
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place the CSV file you want to anonymize in the designated input directory.
2. Update `config.ini` as needed to define column mappings and masking preferences.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python datamask.py
```

4. The anonymized file will be saved as `fake_originalfilename.csv` in the output directory.

## Example

### Input CSV (`input.csv`)

```
id,first,last,ssn,email,phone
1,John,Doe,123-45-6789,john.doe@example.com,555-1234
2,Jane,Smith,987-65-4321,jane.smith@example.com,555-5678
```

### Processed Output CSV (`fake_input.csv`)

```
id,first,last,ssn,email,phone
1,Alice,Brown,XXX-XX-XXXX,alice.brown@example.com,555-0000
2,Bob,Johnson,XXX-XX-XXXX,bob.johnson@example.com,555-1111
```
